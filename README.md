# Rabari_Aman_crushing_bugs

In this drag and drop puzzle you can drang image to the puzzle board and solve the puzzle.

You can not put more than one image at one box. This was the bug of this drag and drop which is now solve. Now game would not allow more than one image in dropbox. So in each box there will be only one Image at a time.

Second bug was if you solve puzzle and then you try to switch puzzle board the puzzle will appears already done. And if you can not reset puzzle while solving it so I gave reset button to puzzles so you can reset puzzle any time.

If you change the puzzke board you will see the puzzle will auto reset.
