# This is drag and drop puzzle game

There were two bugs people were facing in this game which are now solve.

The first problem with puzzle was if player put two images in same box then the first one was disspear and the new one take place of it.
Which is not right the box should allow one image at a time so now that bug is clear now you can not drag and drop more than one image in one specific container.

The second bug was when player solve a puzzle and switch to new puzzle board they founded that the new one was already solved and while solving puzzle if they made mistake 
then they can not solve it. Players could not reset and start from beginning so I have provided reset button in every puzzle so they can reset puzzle when ever they want they do not have to switch puzzle boards every time.
